# 🚦 Traffic Accident Analysis & Visualization 📊

✅ This project was completed as Task-05 under the Data Science Internship program by Prodigy Infotech

Ever wondered how **road conditions**, **weather**, and the **time of day** influence traffic accidents?  
In this data science project, we dive deep into real-world US traffic accident data to discover hidden patterns, pinpoint accident hotspots, and identify contributing factors that make certain roads more dangerous.

By transforming millions of raw data points into meaningful visual stories, this project aims to shed light on how we can make our roads safer through data-driven insights.

## 📌 Project Overview

✨ **Goal:**  
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to:
- Road conditions 🛣️
- Weather 🌧️🌤️
- Time of day ⏰

And **visualize**:
- Accident hotspots 📍
- Key contributing factors 🚨

✨ **Technologies used:**  
- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy for data analysis 📊
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations 📈
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🛠 Dataset

- **Source:** [US Accidents Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)  
- **Description:** Contains over 4 million accident records collected from February 2016 to December 2020 across the United States.
- **Fields include:**  
  `Start_Time`, `End_Time`, `Weather_Condition`, `Visibility`, `Temperature`, `Humidity`, `Wind_Speed`, `Description`, `Severity`, `City`, `State`, and more.

## 🌟 Key Highlights & Insights

🔍 Explored how poor weather and reduced visibility correlate with higher accident severity.  
🕰️ Identified peak accident hours during rush hours in morning and evening.  
📍 Visualized accident hotspots by state and city to reveal high-risk areas.  
💡 Discovered how specific road conditions (like wet or icy roads) significantly increase accident likelihood.

## 📊 Visualizations & Analysis

✅ Distribution of accidents by **time of day** and **day of week**  
✅ Correlation heatmaps to find key factors affecting severity  
✅ Top **weather conditions** during accidents  
✅ Geographical accident density maps to identify hotspots  
✅ Bar charts and trend lines to understand monthly and yearly patterns

All code and visualizations are available in the notebook:
